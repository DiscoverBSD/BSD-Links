### NextBSD
NextBSD is a code name for "science project", a name which is more tongue-in-cheek than serious (naming projects is hard). It started as an effort to adapt some of the more interesting Open Source technologies from Darwin/OS X to FreeBSD.

### OpenBSD
The OpenBSD project produces a FREE, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system.

* [official site](http://raspbsd.org)

### SmallWall
A long time ago, a very smart guy asked a very simple question. "Why do firewalls have to be big, slow, and hard to configure?" And he created m0n0wall.At this, it was amazingly successful. So successful that the FreeBSD based core was used as a basis for several other projects such as pfSense, Askozia, FreeNAS, and nas4free. Recently, a grandchild of m0n0wall was spawned from pfSense, OPNSense. But, m0n0wall has retired now, and some of us still feel the need for a small and lean firewall. SmallWall is that firewall.

### Snasci OS

Snasci OS is a general purpose operating system built upon OpenBSD and the Lumina Desktop Environment. Designed to be very light weight, Snasci OS is quick, responsive and secure. Whether you want a pretty desktop to surf the web, read emails, work with documents or a hardened server platform, Snasci OS provides a nice balance between the two, without compromising on either. Snasci OS comes with a few applications pre-installed. Firefox, Thunderbird and LibreOffice are all available out-of-the-box.
